    "## JSON\n",

    "As explained on the [official JSON Web site](http://www.json.org/), JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format designed for humans as well as for computers. It supports as values:\n",
    "- objects (string-to-value maps)\n",
    "- arrays (ordered sequences of values)\n",

    "JSONiq provides declarative querying and updating capabilities on JSON data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Elevator Pitch\n",
    "\n",
    "JSONiq is based on XQuery, which is a W3C standard (like XML and HTML). XQuery is a very powerful declarative language that originally manipulates XML data, but it turns out that it is also a very good fit for manipulating JSON natively.\n",
    "JSONiq, since it extends XQuery, is a very powerful general-purpose declarative programming language. Our experience is that, for the same task, you will probably write about 80% less code compared to imperative languages like JavaScript, Python or Ruby. Additionally, you get the benefits of strong type checking without actually having to write type declarations.\n",
