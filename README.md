# Rumble

Getting started: you will find a Jupyter notebook that introduces the JSONiq language on top of Rumble [here](https://github.com/ghislainfourny/jsoniq-tutorial). You can use it by installing the all-in-one Data Science platform [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com), unless you prefer to install Python+Spark+PySpark+Jupyter manually (brew, apt...).

The documentation also contains an introduction specific to Rumble and how you can read input datasets, but we have not converted it to Jupyter notebooks yet (this will follow).

[The documentation of the current master (for the adventurous and curious) is available here.](http://sparksoniq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
