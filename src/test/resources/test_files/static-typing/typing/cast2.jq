($base64b cast as hexBinary) is statically hexBinary, ($hexb cast as base64Binary) is statically base64Binary, ($dt cast as date) is statically date, ($dt cast as time) is statically time, ($date cast as dateTime) is statically dateTime, (null cast as null) is statically null, (3 cast as integer?) is statically integer?
