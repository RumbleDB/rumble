/**
 * An ExpressionClassification classifies an expression under 4 possible classifications.
 *
 * A BASIC_UPDATING expression is classified as 1 of 5 expressions in the update package, that can alter the state of
 * an existing node.
 *
 * An UPDATING expression is classified as a BASIC_UPDATING expression or any expression (excluding a
 * TransformExpression) that
 * directly contains an UPDATING expression and that can alter the state of an existing node.
 *
 * A SIMPLE expression is classified as an expression that is not an updating expression.
 *
 * A VACUOUS expression follows the definition of the XQuery Update Facility 1.0, but is largely classified as
 * an expression that can be determined statically to return an empty sequence or raise an error.
