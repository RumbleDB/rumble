This shell allows you to write queries interactively with JSONiq.

Queries can be written on multiple lines with no empty lines inbetween.
Press enter twice to execute your query.

A few example queries you could try out to get started:

1 + 1

json-file("http://rumbledb.org/samples/products-small.json", 10)[1]

count(json-file("http://rumbledb.org/samples/products-small.json", 10))

for $product in json-file("http://rumbledb.org/samples/products-small.json", 10)
where $product.quantity ge 995
return $product

for $i in parallelize(1 to 10000)
group by $m := $i mod 2
return { "m" : $m, "c" : count($i) }
