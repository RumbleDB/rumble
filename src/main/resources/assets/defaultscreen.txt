RumbleDB is a JSONiq engine that can be used both on your laptop or on a
cluster (e.g. with Amazon EMR or Azure HDInsight).

It runs on top of Apache Spark and must be invoked with spark-submit, both for
local use and for cluster use. Spark must be installed either on your laptop,
or on the cluster.

If you do not want to install Spark, then you need to use the standalone jar
instead from www.rumbledb.org.

Usage:
rumbledb <mode> <parameters>

The first optional argument specifies the mode:
**** run ****
for directly running a query from an input file or (with -q) provided directly on the command line.

It is the default mode.

rumbledb run my-query.jq
rumbledb run -q '1+1'

You can specify an output path with -o like so:
rumbledb run -q '1+1' -o my-output.txt

**** serve ****
for running as an HTTP server listening on the specified port (-p) and host (-h).

rumbledb serve -p 9090

RumbleDB also supports Apache Livy for use in Jupyter notebooks, which may be
even more convenient if you are using a cluster.

**** repl ****
for shell mode.

rumbledb repl


**** resource use configuration ****

The docker edition of RumbleDB cannot change the number of cores or the memory allocation.
If you wish to do so, you could consider using the standalone RumbleDB jar.
