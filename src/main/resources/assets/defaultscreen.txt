RumbleDB is a JSONiq engine that can be used both on your laptop or on a
cluster (e.g. with Amazon EMR or Azure HDInsight).

It runs on top of Apache Spark and must be invoked with spark-submit, both for
local use and for cluster use. Spark must be installed either on your laptop,
or on the cluster.

If you do not want to install Spark, then you need to use the standalone jar
instead from www.rumbledb.org.

Usage:
spark-submit <Spark arguments> <path to RumbleDB's jar> <mode> <parameters>

The first optional argument specifies the mode:
**** run ****
for directly running a query from an input file or (with -q) provided directly on the command line.

It is the default mode.

spark-submit rumbledb-1.18.0.jar run my-query.jq
spark-submit rumbledb-1.18.0.jar run -q '1+1'

You can specify an output path with -o like so:
spark-submit rumbledb-1.18.0.jar run -q '1+1' -o my-output.txt

**** serve ****
for running as an HTTP server listening on the specified port (-p) and host (-h).

spark-submit rumbledb-1.18.0.jar serve -p 9090

RumbleDB also supports Apache Livy for use in Jupyter notebooks, which may be
even more convenient if you are using a cluster.

**** repl ****
for shell mode.

spark-submit rumbledb-1.18.0.jar repl


**** resource use configuration ****

For a local use, you can control the number of cores, as well as allocated
memory, with:
spark-submit --master local[*] rumbledb-1.18.0.jar repl
spark-submit --master local[*] rumbledb-1.18.0.jar repl
spark-submit --master local[2] rumbledb-1.18.0.jar repl
spark-submit --master local[*] --driver-memory 10G rumbledb-1.18.0.jar repl

You can use RumbleDB remotely with:
spark-submit --master yarn rumbledb-1.18.0.jar repl

(Although for clusters provided as a service, --master yarn is often implicit
and unnecessary).

For remote use (e.g., logged in on the Spark cluster with ssh), you can set the
number of executors, cores and memory, you can use:
spark-submit --executor-cores 3 --executor-memory 5G rumbledb-1.18.0.jar repl

For remote use, you can also use other file system paths such as S3, HDFS, etc:
spark-submit rumbledb-1.18.0.jar run hdfs://server:port/my-query.jq -o hdfs://server:port/my-output.json
